To run your CUDA programs, please use the GPEL machines.
You are only able to access these machines on OU's network.

If you are not using the internet on campus, please do this:
	 1) Visit this website: https://www.ou.edu/marcomm/cms/get-started/vpn
	2a) MAC users:   Follow "For Mac" and add a VPN network.
	2b) other users: Follow "For PC" and install the Cisco Anyconnect client.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
When you are connected to OU's network, you are now able to log in.
You will use your OU 4x4 and password to login this time, NOT oucspdn0xx!
There are 6 machines. Each has an address:
	gpelX.cs.nor.ou.edu 
	Where X is any number 8 to 13.

!) MAC/Linux users:
   Simply ssh into the machines.
	1) ssh into Your4x4@gpelX.cs.nor.ou.edu
	2) Enter in your password to login!
	Ex. An example student might use: "ssh roux0011@gpelX.cs.nor.ou.edu"

!) Windows users:
   You should use PuTTY and WinSCP to log into the machines.
	PuTTY:
	 1) Under "Host Name (or IP address)", put gpelX.cs.nor.ou.edu.
	 2) Make sure the "Port" is 22.
	 3) The connection type should be SSH.
	 4) Open the connection and enter your 4x4 and password.

	WinSCP:
	 1) Under "Host Name", put gpelX.cs.nor.ou.edu.
	 2) Make sure the "Port number" is 22.
	 3) Your "User name" should be your 4x4
	 4) Open the connection and enter your password.

If your computer cannot find the gpel machine, please check that your 
VPN connection is correct. You must be using OU's network for it to work.

You do not need sbatch files to run your programs like you do on Schooner!
Simply run all of your programs from the command line. :)
